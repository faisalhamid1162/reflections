When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	For backup or sharing with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	When number of contributors increases, the files may be updated very frequently with multiple versions each file along with a large number of branches.  We may not be able to or want to be in sync.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Forks are essentially clones of someone elses repository on Github, created and stored on Github.  Clones are copies made of a repository on Github to the local hard drive of the user.  Branches refer to a split from the current commit stream on your own local computer, which could potentially also be on Github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Can store latest changes for offline work and then sync later.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Using email or other messaging platform with file transfers.  The only thing that would be easier would be the messaging, everything else would be a mess.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	When experimenting with new ideas that may or may not work.  Might add complexity but can save some pain later on.
