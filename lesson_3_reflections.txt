When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	For backup or sharing with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	When number of contributors increases, the files may be updated very frequently with multiple versions each file along with a large number of branches.  We may not be able to or want to be in sync.
