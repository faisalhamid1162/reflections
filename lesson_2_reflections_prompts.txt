What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git is used to start keeping track of the files in there.  This tells git that this folder (including all files and subfolders) are part of a project/repository that require version control to be implemented

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Allows an intermediate space to organize the commits before actually making a commit.  Helps define what each commit should look like without creating useless checkpoints via pointless commits.
