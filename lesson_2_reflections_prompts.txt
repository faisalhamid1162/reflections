What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git is used to start keeping track of the files in there.  This tells git that this folder (including all files and subfolders) are part of a project/repository that require version control to be implemented

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Allows an intermediate space to organize the commits before actually making a commit.  Helps define what each commit should look like without creating useless checkpoints via pointless commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Can only add the logical changes to the staging.  Then the commit will only use those added.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	When making a fundamental change in the design on which further changes will be made it could be useful to use a branch (or multiple branches).  This allows to use commits for each branch and eventually down the line determine which branches to keep.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Easier to see how the branches and commits are connected.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	End up creating a combined branch with one head.  Easy to visualize the history.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

	Can get tedious to manually merge even though it there may not be any conflicts.  However, at times the merge be be incorrect or inefficient.
