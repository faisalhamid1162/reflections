How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help yhou see the bug that was introduced?

	I didn't have to scan the document, just looked for the '-' and '+'.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	Easier to revert back to a version that works without manually maintaining a sequence of old versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Can create versions at logical intervals, when changes are made to address specifc issues or features rather than arbitrarily determined intervals.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because systems like Google docs were not created with code in mind.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	
	Git log will show all changes made in the repository and the diff can show all changes made over two different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Knowing that we can always revert back is comforting.
